If you type 'npm start' into the command line it should work!\r\n - added nodemon as a dependency to package.json \r\n",

            "Number": 291,
            "Title": "Output parse errors for the Rust part of the build step",
            "Body": "This fixes #290, by outputting the parse errors encountered by the Rust build step's parser. Previously they were being stored in the `RcDom` instance's `errors` vector, and ignored. Now they are threaded through to the final `io::Result`, and then output by `main()`.\r\n\r\nThe hardest part of this was adding line numbers to the errors. Doing this necessitated creating a wrapper for `RcDom`, which I inventively called `RcDomWithLineNumbers`, which implements `TreeSink` with two methods `parse_error` and `set_current_line` given custom behavior, while the other many methods just delegate to `RcDom`'s implementation.\r\n\r\n(There doesn't appear to be any better way to do this in Rust, currently. If you search for \"rust delegation\" you'll find lots of discussion of the problem, and various solutions which work if you can modify the delegated-to class, i.e. `RcDom` in our case. But nothing seems to work if the delegated-to class is in third-party code.)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Original PR description</summary>\r\n\r\nI spent some time trying to address https://github.com/whatwg/html-build/issues/290\r\n\r\nThis sort of works. (Although the code needs a lot of cleanup; probably we want to bubble the errors to the top level instead of printing them immediately.)\r\n\r\nHowever, the biggest problem is that there is no line number information. So the output is terrible:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   Compiling html-build v0.0.0 (/home/domenic/src/html-build)\r\n    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 3.14s\r\n     Running `target/release/html-build`\r\nAttributes on an end tag\r\nNo matching tag to close\r\nError: Custom { kind: InvalidData, error: \"Parse errors encountered\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe upstream issue is https://github.com/servo/html5ever/issues/48 .\r\n\r\nI think this is possible to fix if we do something where we override the `RcDom` sink so that instead of [doing nothing when `set_current_line` is called](https://docs.rs/markup5ever/0.11.0/src/markup5ever/interface/tree_builder.rs.html#238), it stores that information somewhere. And then I guess we'd override [the `parse_error` implementation](https://docs.rs/markup5ever_rcdom/latest/src/markup5ever_rcdom/lib.rs.html#224-226) to use that stored information.\r\n\r\nFiguring out how to create some version of `RcDom` with these overrides seems likely to be something Rust supports, but I'm running out time for playing with Rust today. If anyone else wants to pitch in, patches are appreciated.\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n/cc @noamr @jeremyroman \r\n",

            "Title": "Updated my change file with ChatGPT's refactoring changes.",
            "Body": "After asking ChatGPT to help refactor my code, it successfully updated and optimized the issues I addressed that could be improved. This included merging all of my get bills and coins files into a single function, which asked for both the change amount and the denomination of a bill or coin to provide its corresponding change. It also organized all bills and coins to a list of lists, where each entry was a pair of the value of a bill and then its name. It used both of these in a single for loop that would get the count of a bill or coin from the singular function, and then output that bill or coin's name and count to the screen. Lastly, it provided an error check for both checking if the input value was a float (using a try except block), and another check that the decimal only had a precision of up to two places. ChatGPT's optimized code helped teach me how to utilize lists as well as returning multiple variables from a function to efficiently accomplish two tasks (finding the change and then outputting to the screen) simultaneously under a single for loop. It also reduced the line count of the program from 115 lines to 46, more than halving the length of the code and providing cleaner readability. Closes #54.\r\n\r\nConversation:\r\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/968d797a-0ef8-4644-91b9-70d1a3d0c016",

I wasn't even aware that we have this configured, as it is from v4.0.0.\r\n\r\nI switched the behavior slightly but also upgraded out of a legacy syntax.\r\n\r\nThe real direct equivalent would be `* -text`, but this would have the downside that it only affects when checking files out.\r\nThe `* text eol=lf` is different in that way that it affects the files when you checkin files to the repo. Resulting in new created files directly with the \"correct\" lf ending. However in most files prettier would do that for us anyway, so only files that are NOT supported by prettier would be affected.\r\n\r\n- https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes\r\n- https://chat.openai.com/share/bbb3bb28-cb2d-436e-beb8-af36537c0897\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe have some png files in the docs.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/assets/7195563/b749dead-0c5f-4f30-9ff1-e79e468254e8)\r\n\r\nAdding `*.png binary` fixed that.\r\n\r\nAnd here you instantly see in action the difference :slightly_smiling_face:\r\nAs png are not supported by prettier, it would not add eol=lf to such files when checkin in, and that was previously not the case.\r\nNow the gitattributes are more verbose and specific.",

This is still the behaviour on Windows but not Unix.\r\n\r\n### What was wrong\r\n\r\nPython's random module is itself inconsistent about mis-ordered arguments to random.randint versus random.uniform. This bubbled up to a different behaviour on Windows and Unix because those different functions are used depending on the platform.\r\n\r\n### How this fixes it\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that on both Windows and Unix, an exception is thrown. This is \"backwards compatible\" to older versions of Faker and compatible across platforms. It is not backwards compatible to the very most recent versions of Faker, when running on Unix, because it re-introduces the exception.\r\n\r\nOn all platforms, the exception is a ValueError that contains the string \"empty range\" and this can be used by callers to detect the problem. Snowfakery, for example, has code to detect this problem and report it nicely to users.\r\n\r\nFixes #...\r\n",

And I made a first pass at using pre-generated anoncreds definitions in tests. The tests i did this for were significantly faster\r\n",

I think I have something misconfigured that's not part of the Mudlet repo.

Chat GPT for help. Here you can find our full conversation history [https://chat.openai.com/share/b093ae6f-e16f-455c-a4d2-c2a23542111d](https://chat.openai.com/share/b093ae6f-e16f-455c-a4d2-c2a23542111d).\r\n\r\nUnfortunatelly, Chat GPT does not care very much about things like SOLID, architectural patterns, clean code, DI and testing. So the code looks to be in a **very** rough state. But it runs and meets the requirements.\r\n\r\nHowever, my goal was to finish the task in \u00b13 hours - I couldn't justify spending any more of my time on this. So this is what we're stuck with.\r\n",

            "Title": "Parse LaTeX matrices and literal complex numbers",
            "Body": "Fixes #14007 \r\nAddresses https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/25676 and https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/25366\r\n\r\nI have written this with the goal of using a purely SymPy-based backend (or SymPy as a part of SageMath) in [symtex.el](https://github.com/ultronozm/symtex.el) and [compuTeX](https://github.com/8vasu/compuTeX). I wish to unify the typesetting and computation aspects of working with matrix groups in my GNU Emacs/AUCTeX-based workflow. \r\n\r\nEdit: I do not mean to rush anyone, but the reason for this PR is that the `latex2sympy2` that we are currently using in our projects depends on ANTLR 4.7, which imports `typing.io`. We keep getting  warnings that `typing.io` is deprecated and that it will be completely removed in Python 3.12. Currently I am using the default Python 3.11 in Debian, but that might change in an OS update/upgrade in the near future. We have found a parsing solution using GNU Emacs Calc, but we depend on SymPy's `parse_expr` anyway. Matrices are a must for us, and I am looking for a clean solution that just uses `parse_latex`.\r\n\r\nEdit: This PR is being split into 2 parts. Currently this only has content for the Lark parser. The following message remains unchanged, and still mentions ANTLR, which is to be ignored.\r\n\r\nEdit: added `\\prime` and `\\ast` as new ways of performing matrix transpose and matrix self-adjoint.\r\n\r\n## Overview of features added or modified:\r\n\r\n1. Matrix parsing is added to both the ANTLR-based and the\r\nLark-based parsers.\r\n2. Literal complex numbers are introduced via the LaTeX macro\r\n`\\sympyi` in order to facilitate working with matrices with complex\r\nnumber entries.\r\n3. Since the single quote (prime) symbol is sometimes used to denote\r\nmatrix transpose, that is introduced, and as a side-effect, primed\r\nsymbols are added to the Lark parser, and the behavior of primes\r\non symbols in ANTLR and Lark are made consistent and completely\r\nfaithful to the input. For example, the input `\"a''_{b'''}''''\"`\r\ngenerates `sympy.Symbol(\"a''_{b'''}''''\")`. Before this commit, the\r\nANTLR-based parser would generate `sympy.Symbol(\"a_{b'}\")` from the\r\ninput `\"a_b'\"`; LaTeX compilers interpret this differently: the\r\nprime in `\"a_b'\"` is rendered on the `\"a\"` as opposed to the `\"b\"`. This\r\ncommit follows the convention followed by LaTeX compilers.\r\n\r\n## List of features added:\r\n\r\n1. Imaginary unit: `\\sympyi`\r\n2. Matrix parsing (`array` and AMS-LaTeX `matrix`, `pmatrix`, `bmatrix`)\r\nand detailed error handling\r\n3. Determinant parsing (`\\det`, `vmatrix`, `|array matrix|`,\r\n`|AMS-LaTeX matrix|`)\r\n4. Transpose via superscripts `^T`, `^{T}`, `^{'}`, `'`. Applied multiple\r\ntimes via `''`, `'''`, ..., `^{''}`, `^{'''}`, ...\r\n5. Conjugate transpose via superscripts `^H`, `^{H}`, `^{*}`. Applied\r\nmultiple times via `^{**}`, `^{***}`, ...\r\n6. Matrix Trace: `\\sympytr`\r\n7. Matrix adjugate: `\\sympyadj`\r\n8. The above matrix functionality works on all matrix expressions\r\nand not just individual literal matrices; for example, `\\det` can\r\nbe applied to the sum of 2 LaTeX matrices.\r\n9. Large number of new tests for all new functionality.\r\n\r\n## List of features modified:\r\n\r\n1. Symbols (one letter, greek, multi-letter, subscripted) can have\r\nprimes (single quotes) on them in the Lark grammar.\r\n2. Primes on output symbols and functions are now completely\r\nfaithful to the input strings (see added tests).\r\n3. In the Lark grammar, integral, derivative, and limit\r\nexpressions have been moved from `_expression_mul` to `_expression_func`\r\nso that, for instance, integrals can be multiplied with each other.\r\n4. In the Lark grammar, the rule `adjacent_expressions` has been\r\nmodified so that `\"fraction _expression\"` is now\r\n`\"fraction _expression_mul\"`. This is done to eliminate the incorrect\r\nalternatives in the ambiguous interpretations of `\\frac{a}{b} x+y`,\r\n`\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{x}{y}`, `\\frac{a}{b} - \\frac{x}{y}`, etc.\r\n5. The Lark grammar now understands `\"+ expression\"` as just\r\n`\"expression\"`.\r\n6. Some tests have been modified to reflect change in behavior.\r\n\r\n    Relevant issue: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/14007\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\n<!-- Write the release notes for this release below between the BEGIN and END\r\nstatements.

            "Body": "`nwsapi` has been working great so far, and I appreciate the developer's hard work, but `nwsapi` is unable to support Selectors Level 4 properly at the moment.\r\nYou can find many selector-related bug reports in the `jsdom` issues.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I recommend changing to a different CSS selector engine [dom-selector](https://github.com/asamuzaK/domSelector).\r\nIt supports many features of the Selectors Level 4 and also the Shadow Hosts.\r\nRef [Supported CSS selectors](https://github.com/asamuzaK/domSelector#supported-css-selectors)\r\n\r\n# Benchmark results\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run benchmark\r\n```\r\n\r\n|API|nwsapi|dom-selector|\r\n|:--------|:--------|:--------|\r\n|closest()|jsdom x 126,133 ops/sec \u00b10.75% (73 runs sampled)|jsdom x 7,449 ops/sec \u00b113.28% (64 runs sampled)|\r\n|matches()|jsdom x 120,369 ops/sec \u00b18.31% (65 runs sampled)|jsdom x 8,507 ops/sec \u00b17.84% (60 runs sampled)|\r\n|querySelector()|jsdom x 3.12 ops/sec \u00b12.60% (12 runs sampled)|jsdom x 14.72 ops/sec \u00b11.94% (35 runs sampled)|\r\n|querySelectorAll()|jsdom x 2.93 ops/sec \u00b11.52% (11 runs sampled)|jsdom x 12.41 ops/sec \u00b12.47% (31 runs sampled)|\r\n\r\nFor `closest()` and `matches()`, `nwsapi` is about 15 times faster, but in reality, `dom-selector` processed in 0.11 to 0.13 msec, so I don't think it's extremely slow.\r\nRather, it is `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` that often have speed performance issues, and in this benchmark, `dom-selector` is about 4 times faster than `nwsapi`.\r\n",

More importantly, rendering the page expanded and then collapsing it with JavaScript seems like the right thing to do from an accessibility standpoint: We'd want the page to still be useful without JavaScript. I've been known to access API documentation in the terminal with `w3m`, so not relying on JavaScript to render the core content is something I actually care about. Screenreaders probably also wouldn't like if all docstrings initially rendered as `hidden`.\r\n\r\nCloses #2282",

Now, whenever the model tries to click on anything, it will send another additional request to GPT giving it a chance to adjust its initial percentage guesses.\r\n\r\nI first extract out the initial guess of where the model tries to click, and then I take a screenshot of a smaller 200 x 200 pixel rectangle around the initial guess. I then upsample the image by doubling the dimensions so it's bigger to GPT (all done in capture_mini_screenshot_with_cursor) and then ask the model to refine its guess, giving it the previous image/message as context as well as the previous X Y coordinate guess it attempted and give it a chance to add and subtract minute percentages (accurate_mode_double_check).\r\n\r\nLocally, this configuration has significantly improved the accuracy of clicking on my desktop configuration (two monitors). Currently I've only implemented it for Linux, but if this approach is liked it can easily be adapted to other OS.\r\n\r\nIdea could be further improved if the add_grid_to_image is further improved such that in the accurate_mode adding grid case to the mini screenshot, if instead of (25%, 25%) in the first intersection, instead it was (-3%, -5%) for example so it was just the relative percentage change. This will probably allow the model to have an easier time adding and subtracting the proper amount in the refined click.\r\n\r\nAlso I almost arbitrarily chose 200 x 200 as the rectangle size. I just noticed that on my desktop, the model would often be wrong by more than 100 pixels away, but less than 200 pixels so I just chose that as the size.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to improve my code, or explain anything as wanted!\r\n\r\nPS: I also added poetry support. But I can delete this and just add all of those files to .gitignore",

This was because of fastcheck sometimes generating a string value of `__proto__` for the `identityId`. The `identityId` is used as the key for the object that comes out of RocksDB, there is a problem with prototype pollution. This is not only a security issue, but also that `JSON.stringify` does not serialize the `__proto__` property of an object, so certain the provider keys for that identity will never work. This PR uses `Object.defineProperty`to correctly set the `__proto__` property on the `providerTokens` object.\r\n\r\n### Issues Related\r\n* https://github.com/MatrixAI/Polykey-CLI/issues/40#issuecomment-1778016364\r\n* Fixes #608 \r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n<!-- \r\n  List all tasks to be done by this PR.\r\n  If a task is no longer required, add a strikethrough (including the checkbox):\r\n  - ~~[ ] 3. ...~~ - being completed in #...\r\n-->\r\n- [x] 1.

            "Title": "Enhancements to Tournament Creation and Editing for Non-Staff Users",
            "Body": "**Description:**\r\n\r\nThis PR relates to issue #172 and introduces several key updates to the tournament management system, focusing on the capabilities of non-staff users. The changes are aimed at providing non-staff users with greater autonomy in creating and managing tournaments while maintaining necessary oversight and control mechanisms. The updates include modifications to both the front-end (CRUD pages) and the back-end (Tournament model and related views).\r\n\r\n**Key Changes:**\r\n\r\n1. **Tournament Creation with Token Usage**: Non-staff users can now create tournaments, deducting one token from their account per tournament created. This enforces a token-based permission system, integrating with the User team's token management functionality.\r\n\r\n2. **Partial Edit Control for Tournament Creators**: Creators of a tournament (non-staff users who created a tournament) have been granted partial editing control over their tournaments. This includes updating certain attributes of the tournament. However, they cannot add or remove matches or players \u2013 actions which require staff intervention.\r\n\r\n3. **Access Control on Tournaments**: Non-staff users can only access tournaments they are part of. The `TournamentListView` has been modified to filter out tournaments that the user is not participating in, enhancing privacy and focus.\r\n\r\n4. **Restriction on Tournament Deletion**: Non-staff users are not permitted to delete or disable tournaments they created. Such actions must be routed through staff users due to the complex backend events triggered by a tournament's deletion.\r\n\r\n5. **Model Enhancements**: The `Tournament` model has been updated to include a `created_by` field, ensuring clarity on ownership. This field is critical for implementing the above functionalities, particularly around editing permissions and access control.\r\n\r\n**Technical Details:**\r\n\r\n- `TournamentCreateView` and `TournamentUpdateView` have been modified to check the user's token balance and ownership, respectively. `TournamentCreateView` deducts one token for each tournament created.\r\n- The `Tournament` model's `created_by` field links to the `User` model, establishing tournament ownership.\r\n- The `get_queryset` method in `TournamentListView` filters tournaments based on user participation and staff status.\r\n- `distribute_tokens()` is a future-proof function for automatically reloading each user\u2019s token balance after 30 days. It has been commented out so that the Users group can make necessary modifications to their `User` model beforehand.",

            "Body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new API function, and a set of test cases to validate its functionality.        This feature enhancement enhances the CAMEL project by providing access to current weather data based on geographical coordinates.\r\nThis update integrates features related to the OpenWeatherMap API, enabling new weather-related functionality.\r\n\r\nIn order to use these new features, an API key from OpenWeatherMap is required. Contributors and users who want to run this code will need to:\r\n\r\n1. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up at https://openweathermap.org/api \uff08free API is enough to this function\uff09.\r\n2. Once you have the key, it should be stored securely in the environment variables as 'OPENWEATHER_API_KEY'. This is critical to ensure the security and privacy of your API key. Please do not hardcode the key into your codebase.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure the 'OPENWEATHER_API_KEY' is correctly configured in the environment before running the application. Incorrect handling of the API key may lead to errors or unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this requirement as we integrate these exciting new weather features.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\nWeather data is a valuable resource for a wide range of applications, from optimizing energy consumption to improving travel safety.     Users of the CAMEL project have expressed the need for a reliable and easy-to-use way to access current weather information based on geographical coordinates.     This addition of the `fetch_current_weather` API fulfills that need, providing real-time weather data to CAMEL users, enhancing their experience, and enabling new possibilities for data analysis.\r\n\r\n**Context:**\r\nPrior to this change, users had to rely on external services or implement custom solutions to obtain weather data.     The `fetch_current_weather` API simplifies this process, making it more accessible and integrated within the CAMEL framework.     This addition aligns with our project's goal of providing comprehensive and user-friendly AI capabilities.     It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather information, which complements the existing functionality of CAMEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn issue has been raised to propose this change (https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/issues/57)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds core functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] Documentation (update in the documentation)\r\n- [ ] Example (update in the folder of example)\r\n\r\n## Implemented Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] Current Weather\r\n- [ ] 3-hour Forecast 5 days\r\n- [ ] Basic weather maps\r\n- [ ] Air Pollution API\r\n- [ ] Geocoding API\r\n- [ ] A example of role playing with weather function\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [CONTRIBUTION](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

The file \"supplier_configs_reader_test.go\" includes the addition of a new test function \"Test_ParseSupplierConfigs\" and test cases for valid and invalid service configurations.\n\n2. The Makefile has been updated with changes related to staking tokens for suppliers. The \"supplier_stake\" target has been modified to include the SUPPLIER_CONFIG environment variable, and the SERVICES variable has been replaced with a YAML configuration file for each supplier. Additional targets have been added for staking specific suppliers (supplier1, supplier2, supplier3), each with its own YAML configuration file. A new target \"supplier_unstake\" has been added for unstaking a supplier.\n\n3. A new file \"supplier1_stake_config.yaml\" has been added to the \"localnet/poktrolld/config\" directory. The changes in this file include adding services for apps and suppliers to stake for, making GetSession testable, and ensuring Genesis-staked actors are available via AccountKeeper. Additionally, configurations for the \"anvil\" service and \"svc1\" service have been added.\n\n4. Another new file called \"errors.go\" has been introduced in the \"x/supplier/client/config\" package. This file defines various error variables related to supplier configuration.\n\n5. The file \"supplier_configs_reader.go\" in the \"x/supplier/client/config\" package has also been modified. It contains several structs and functions related to parsing and validating a stake config file for a supplier service.\n\n6. The file \"tx_stake_supplier.go\" in the \"x/supplier/client/cli/\" directory has undergone changes. These changes include import statement modifications, variable additions and replacements, and command description updates.\n\n7. Finally, a new file named \"supplier2_stake_config.yaml\" has been added. This file includes two service configurations with their respective endpoint URLs and RPC types.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance.\n<!-- reviewpad:summarize:end -->\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\n- #137 \r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nSelect one or more:\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature, functionality or library\r\n- [ ] Bug fix\r\n- [ ] Code health or cleanup\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ] Other (specify)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] **Run all unit tests**: `make go_develop_and_test`\r\n- [ ] **Verify Localnet manually**: See the instructions [here](TODO: add link to instructions)\r\n\r\n## Sanity Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested my changes using the available tooling\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, updated documentation and left TODOs throughout the codebase\r\n",

Previously this would be written `\"https://*:*@example.com/*\\\\?*#*\"`.\n2. `new URLPattern({ pathname: \"/login\" }, \"https://example.com/?q=hello\")` accepts any query string and hash, not only `\"?q=hello\"` and `\"\"`.\n3. `\"https://*:*\"` or `{protocol: \"https\"}` means \"any HTTPS URL, on any port\", and `\"https://*\"` means \"any HTTPS URL on the default port (443)\". These have the same meaning whether or not a base URL is provided, since specifying the protocol prohibits inheritance of other components.\n\nThis makes patterns more expansive than before, in cases where wildcards are likely to be desirable.\n\nThe logic of inheriting components from a base URL dictionary is also similarly changed in a way that may make it _not_ match where it did before, but more consistently with the above and with how relative URL strings are resolved. For example, `new URLPattern(\"https://example.com/foo?q=1#hello\").test({pathname: \"/foo\", hash: \"hello\", baseURL: \"https://example.com/bar?q=1\"})` previously returned `true` but will now be `false`, since the search component is not inherited when the pathname is specified. This is analogous to how `new URL(\"/foo#hello\", \"https://example.com/bar?q=1\")` works. The reverse is also possible; in both cases this is quite niche.\n\nFixes #179.\n\n---\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing to the URL Pattern Standard!
